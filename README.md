# Quantum Battleship

A Battleship boardgame implementation using [IBM Qiskit](https://qiskit.org), following [this tutorial by decodoku](https://medium.com/@decodoku/how-to-program-a-quantum-computer-982a9329ed02), forked from [@RavenPillmann](https://github.com/RavenPillmann/quantum-battleship) and updated for the current Qiskit version.

## How it works

Run a battleship game on either a simulated or real quantum computer. If you want to run the game on a real quantum computer, you will have to obtain an IBM Q API token from [here](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/account/advanced) first.

*more information soon.*
